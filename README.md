# Alex---the-AI-Assistant

Python is a brand-new language, thus you may simply script the Voice wizard in Python as you are aware. Wizard commands may be handled in accordance with user needs. The process of turning voice into text is called speech recognition. Alexa, Siri, and other voice assistants often utilize this. Python offers a voice recognition API that can translate spoken words into text. It was fun having you as my helper. With just one voice command, you may launch your preferred IDE, search Google without using a browser, send emails without typing a word, and do a number of other commonplace operations. Tasks are simpler to do than ever before. In the present situation, technological advancements have made it possible for us to execute any work as well or better than we do. I came to see that his AI technology might minimize human labour and save time across the board after starting this job. 

These are this project's characteristics: 
1. You can email someone. 
2. Use WhatsApp to send SMS. 
3. You may launch Notepad, your preferred IDE, Command Prompt, etc. 
4. You can search Wikipedia. 
5. You may use your web browser to access websites like Google, YouTube, and others. 
6. A weather prediction is available. 

Here, a basic question is raised. How does AI work? The virtual assistant I created is not an artificial intelligence; rather, it resembles the result of a number of instructions. But at its core, AI devices are designed to execute human activities as effectively as or perhaps more effectively than people.
